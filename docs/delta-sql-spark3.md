# Delta SQL and Spark 3.0.0

As of 0.7.0 Delta Lake supports Spark 3 (starting from the first http://spark.apache.org/news/spark-3-0-0-released.html[3.0.0] release).

With the support, Delta tables are available to Spark SQL as DeltaTableV2.adoc[logical writable tables] (similar to Hive or native tables in Spark 2).
